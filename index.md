This Documentation aims to help you explore and understand the QEWDjs Framework 
 

## The Background To QEWDjs:

Read the article [Having your NodeJS Cake and Eating it Too](https://robtweed.wordpress.com/2017/04/18/having-your-node-js-cake-and-eating-it-too/), which explains the thinking behind QEWDjs and its unique architecture:

You might also find the [slides from Rob Tweed's talk at the London Node.js Users Group](https://www.slideshare.net/robtweed/lnug-having-your-nodejs-cake-and-eating-it-too) useful.


## Getting Started With QEWD.js:

If you want to use QEWD.js on a Linux system or even a Raspberry Pi, the  simplest way to get started 
is to use one of the [pre-built installers](https://github.com/robtweed/qewd/tree/master/installers).

An even quicker and simpler approach is to use the [QEWD.js Docker Appliance](https://www.slideshare.net/robtweed/ewd-3-training-course-part-42-the-qewd-docker-appliance)

If you're a Windows user, or prefer to install and configure QEWD.js manually, [use this guide](https://www.slideshare.net/robtweed/installing-configuring-ewdxpress).

## A Reference REST Implementation using QEWD.js

If you want to learn how to use QEWD.js to create a set of REST APIs, a good starting point is the [Introducing Realworld.io](https://medium.com/@ericsimons/introducing-realworld-6016654d36b5) project which defines a reference application 
(Conduit) against which a number of front-end and back-end implementations have been created.

One of the back-end implementations is the [Realworld QEWDjs backend](https://github.com/gothinkster/QEWD-realworld-example-app).  This entire back-end implementation was created in just 2 man-days: demonstrating the extreme productivity of QEWD.js
